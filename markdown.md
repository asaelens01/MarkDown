# Creator of MarkDown :

## Escaping Characters : 

To display a literal character that would otherwise be used to format text in a Markdown document, add a backslash (\) in front of the character.

| :-------: | :------------------ |
|    \\     | backslash           |
|    \`     | backtick            |
|    \*     | asterisk            |
|    \_     | underscore          |
|    \{}    | curly braces        |
|    \[]    | brackets            |
|    \()    | parenthèses         |
|    \#     | dièse               |
|    \+     | plus sign           |
|    \-     | minus sign          |
|    \.     | dot                 |

**This is a little code in C to print the alphabet in reverse without writing each letters by yourself** :  

    #include <unistd.h>

    void	ft_putchar(char c)
    {
	    write(1, &c, 1);
    }

    void	ft_print_reverse_alphabet(void)
    {   
	    char letter;

	    letter = 'z';
	    while (letter >= 'a')
	    {
		    t_putchar(letter);
		    letter--;
	    }
    }
